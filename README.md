# Data API to access Argus Monitor sensor data

This is the public data API for the fan control and system monitoring tool [Argus Monitor](https://www.argusmonitor.com). Its inteded purpose is to provide easy read access to all sensor information of a running instance of Argus Monitor.

The data API in version 1.0 is now in a state in which it providedes access to all internal sensor information. It might be extended in the future, but without breaking code that relies on it in its current form.

Feedback and suggestions for improvements are welcome.
